        <h2>Introduction to Me</h2>
        
        <p class="intro">
        Hi, I was born and raised in a small town, in Alabama.
        <b>My family has always been a big influence in my life.</b>
        I have one older  siblings, a niece and a nephew. One of my favorite hobbies is reading. 
        I enjoy writing  fan-fiction and reading fiction and non-fiction; especially historical fiction. 
        I am currently plot building, and filling on gaps of my story, while reacting Human Acts by Han Kang :D. 
        Reading has been a great way for me to unwind and learn about different cultures and history.</p>
        <p>Another hobby is pet sitting, and I am currently traveling the North East, visting new homes while working with Rover. </p>
